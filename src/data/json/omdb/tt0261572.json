	"plot": "This film covers the events of October 1970 when separate cells of the Quebec seperatist terrorist organization, Le Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ), kidnap the British Trade Consul, James Cross, and the Quebec Minister of Labor, Pierre Laporte. In response, the Canadian Prime Minister invoked the War Measures Act, in response to what seemed to be an insurrection, which gave the police sweeping powers and called out the military in order to stop the FLQ and find their captives. This film recounts the events of this move and it's consequences of that faithful month in Canadian history.",
