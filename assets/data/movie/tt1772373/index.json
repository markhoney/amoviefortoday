Seemingly destined for greatness as one of Boston University's brightest med students, Markoff could do no wrong in the eyes of Megan, his friends, fellow students and professors. But hidden from those close to him was the violent wrath only he and his victims knew - beginning with his alleged April 14, 2009, first-degree murder of a masseuse who advertised her services on Craigslist.
