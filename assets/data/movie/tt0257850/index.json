This is a film version of the play they wrote based on more than 200 interviews they conducted in Laramie. It follows and in some cases re-enacts the chronology of Shepard's visit to a local bar, his kidnap and beating, the discovery of him tied to a fence, the vigil at the hospital, his death and funeral, and the trial of his killers. It mixes real news reports with actors portraying friends, family, cops, killers, and other Laramie residents in their own words. It concludes with a Laramie staging of \"Angels in America\" a year after Shephard's death.","year":{"id":"2002","path":"/released/2002/"},"score":{"id":"73"},"runtime":97,"awards":"Nominated for 4 Primetime Emmys.
