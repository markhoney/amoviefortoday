Her fear deepens after her colleague, Jong-sook, tells her that 12 years earlier a prisoner transport vehicle caused a traffic accident wherein all the prisoners involved died - and some of the corpses disappeared. Since then, a murder has occurred near the tollgate on February 29th, every four years. Soon, odd events become increasingly frequent, usually involving a doppelganger of Ji-yeon. When Jong-sook is killed on the fateful February 29th, Ji-yeon - with the help of two detectives - starts looking into matters herself.","year":{"id":"2006","path":"/released/2006/"},"score":{"id":"57"},"runtime":90,"awards":"","directors":[{"title":"Jong-hoon Jung","path":"/directors/jong-hoon_jung/"}],"actors":[{"title":"Eun-jin Baek","path":"/actors/eun-jin_baek/"},{"title":"Yoon-jeong Choi","path":"/actors/yoon-jeong_choi/"},{"title":"Hyeon-kyeong Im","path":"/actors/hyeon-kyeong_im/"},{"title":"Myeong-jin Lee","path":"/actors/myeong-jin_lee/"}],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"classification":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Horror","image":"/img/genres/Horror.png","path":"/genres/horror/"},{"title":"Thriller","image":"/img/genres/Thriller.png","path":"/genres/thriller/"}],"countries":[{"title":"South Korea","image":"/img/countries/maps/South Korea.png","path":"/countries/south_korea/"}],"languages":[{"title":"Korean","image":"/img/countries/flags/kr.svg","path":"/languages/korean/"}],"events":[{"id":"2-29-tt0927575","title":"Jong-sook is killed","year":null,"info":{"wikipedia":null},"dayofyear":{"path":"/february/29/","month":{"id":"february","title":"February","path":"/february/"},"day":{"id":"29","ordinal":"th"}}}]}},"context":{}}
