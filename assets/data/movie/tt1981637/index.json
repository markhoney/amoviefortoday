Premiered in America the film is pilloried by ultra-right religious groups for its depiction of Christ. In England the Popular Peoples' Church of St Sophia (whose members include a Tourette's sufferer who shouts out swear words) find a copy of the script in a dustbin and lobby the British censor for its suppression, leading to many local councils banning its screening. Death threats follow and Michael Palin - \"the nicest man in Britain\" - has his effigy burned on his front lawn. Finally crazed TV programmer Alan Dick persuades Palin and co-star John Cleese to defend the picture on a late night chat show against the Bishop of Southwark and religious commentator Malcolm Muggeridge. Thanks to Cleese's reasoning the Pythons are seen to triumph, winning over the Popular Peoples' Church. A later encounter with God will show how the film's controversy paved the way for other artistic endeavours which prompted protest. Brilliant characterisations are vitiated by a satirical 'treatment' including animated sequences and irritating attempts at surreal wit when a documentary style treatment would have sufficed. Several of the Pythons were hostile to the film, summed up in the floor manager's comment. \"Another fantasy sequence...lame\".","year":{"id":"2011","path":"/released/2011/"},"score":{"id":"71"},"runtime":89,"awards":"1 win & 3 nominations.","directors":[{"title":"Owen Harris","path":"/directors/owen_harris/"}],"actors":[{"title":"Ben Crispin","path":"/actors/ben_crispin/"},{"title":"Steve Punt","path":"/actors/steve_punt/"},{"title":"Charles Edwards","path":"/actors/charles_edwards/"},{"title":"Rufus Jones","path":"/actors/rufus_jones/"}],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"classification":{"title":"NOT RATED","path":"/classifications/not_rated/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Comedy","image":"/img/genres/Comedy.png","path":"/genres/comedy/"},{"title":"Drama","image":"/img/genres/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"}],"countries":[{"title":"UK","image":"/img/countries/maps/United Kingdom.png","path":"/countries/uk/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}],"events":[{"id":"11-9-tt1981637","title":"Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood discuss Monty Python's Life of Brian on TV with John Cleese and Michael Palin","year":{"id":"1979","path":"/years/1979/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night,_Saturday_Morning#Monty_Python.27s_Life_of_Brian"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/november/9/","month":{"id":"november","title":"November","path":"/november/"},"day":{"id":"9","ordinal":"th"}}}]}},"context":{}}
