In response, the Canadian Prime Minister invoked the War Measures Act, in response to what seemed to be an insurrection, which gave the police sweeping powers and called out the military in order to stop the FLQ and find their captives. This film recounts the events of this move and it's consequences of that faithful month in Canadian history.","year":{"id":"2000","path":"/released/2000/"},"score":{"id":"71"},"runtime":120,"awards":"","bechdel":null,"directors":[],"actors":[{"title":"Terence McKenna","path":"/actors/terence_mckenna/"},{"title":"René Gagnon","path":"/actors/ren%C3%A9_gagnon/"},{"title":"Jérome Choquette","path":"/actors/j%C3%A9rome_choquette/"},{"title":"Marc Lalonde","path":"/actors/marc_lalonde/"}],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null,"logo":null},"classification":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Documentary","image":"/img/genres/Documentary.png","path":"/genres/documentary/"},{"title":"History","image":"/img/genres/History.png","path":"/genres/history/"}],"countries":[{"title":"Canada","image":"/img/countries/maps/Canada.png","path":"/countries/canada/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}],"events":[{"id":"10-5-tt0261572","title":"","year":{"id":"1970","path":"/years/1970/"},"info":{"wikipedia":null},"dayofyear":{"path":"/october/5/","month":{"id":"october","title":"October","path":"/october/"},"day":{"id":"5","ordinal":"th"}}}]}},"context":{}}
