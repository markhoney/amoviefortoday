To that end, the British present King Cetshwayo with an impossible ultimatum to provoke a war they are sure they can win easily with their rifles and artillery against native spears. However, that war proves more difficult than the arrogant British commander, Lord Chelmsford, expects as his overburdened army fruitlessly searches for the elusive enemy. However, in the shadow of a hill called Isandlwana, the overconfident British army learns to its sorrow just how badly they have underestimated the tactical skill and might of the Zulu nation.","year":{"id":"1979","path":"/released/1979/"},"score":{"id":"66"},"runtime":98,"awards":"1 win.","directors":[{"title":"Douglas Hickox","path":"/directors/douglas_hickox/"}],"actors":[{"title":"Burt Lancaster","path":"/actors/burt_lancaster/"},{"title":"Simon Ward","path":"/actors/simon_ward/"},{"title":"Denholm Elliott","path":"/actors/denholm_elliott/"},{"title":"Peter Vaughan","path":"/actors/peter_vaughan/"}],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"classification":{"title":"PG","path":"/classifications/pg/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Adventure","image":"/img/genres/Adventure.png","path":"/genres/adventure/"},{"title":"Drama","image":"/img/genres/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"},{"title":"History","image":"/img/genres/History.png","path":"/genres/history/"},{"title":"War","image":"/img/genres/War.png","path":"/genres/war/"}],"countries":[{"title":"Netherlands","image":"/img/countries/maps/Netherlands.png","path":"/countries/netherlands/"},{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"},{"title":"Zulu","image":"/img/countries/flags/za.svg","path":"/languages/zulu/"}],"events":[{"id":"1-22-tt0080180","title":"the Battle of Isandlwana is fought","year":{"id":"1879","path":"/years/1879/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/january/22/","month":{"id":"january","title":"January","path":"/january/"},"day":{"id":"22","ordinal":"nd"}}}]}},"context":{}}
