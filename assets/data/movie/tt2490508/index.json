The Kartemquin film features then and now interviews with organizers and participants of the boycott with never-released 16mm footage of the march and student interviews. 63 Boycott and its companion website will provide a modern perspective on the impact and legacy of this forgotten history 50 years later as it reconnects the participants to each other and the event itself.","year":{"id":"2014","path":"/released/2014/"},"score":null,"runtime":null,"awards":"","bechdel":null,"directors":[{"title":"Gordon Quinn","path":"/directors/gordon_quinn/"}],"actors":[],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null,"logo":null},"classification":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Documentary","image":"/img/genres/Documentary.png","path":"/genres/documentary/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}],"events":[{"id":"10-22-tt2490508","title":"","year":{"id":"1963","path":"/years/1963/"},"info":{"wikipedia":null},"dayofyear":{"path":"/october/22/","month":{"id":"october","title":"October","path":"/october/"},"day":{"id":"22","ordinal":"nd"}}}]}},"context":{}}
