In the early 1960s, Héctor arrives in New York from Ponce, Puerto Rico. Success comes quickly. \"The more he grew as an artist,\" Puchi says, \"the more he sank as a person.\" It's a tale of talent - creating salsa with Willie Colón, with the Fania All Stars, and as a soloist - and a story of disintegration - fueled by drugs, alcohol, partying, and depression. Puchi's voice - proud and querulous - dominates off-stage as Héctor's does on.","year":{"id":"2006","path":"/released/2006/"},"score":{"id":"55"},"runtime":106,"awards":"","directors":[{"title":"Leon Ichaso","path":"/directors/leon_ichaso/"}],"actors":[{"title":"Marc Anthony","path":"/actors/marc_anthony/"},{"title":"Jennifer Lopez","path":"/actors/jennifer_lopez/"},{"title":"John Ortiz","path":"/actors/john_ortiz/"},{"title":"Manny Perez","path":"/actors/manny_perez/"}],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"classification":{"title":"R","path":"/classifications/r/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Biography","image":"/img/genres/Biography.png","path":"/genres/biography/"},{"title":"Drama","image":"/img/genres/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"},{"title":"Music","image":"/img/genres/Music.png","path":"/genres/music/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"Spanish","image":"/img/countries/flags/es.svg","path":"/languages/spanish/"},{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}],"events":[{"id":"5-3-tt0458522","title":"Héctor Lavoe moves to New York","year":{"id":"1963","path":"/years/1963/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Héctor_Lavoe#Arrival_in_New_York_City"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/may/3/","month":{"id":"may","title":"May","path":"/may/"},"day":{"id":"3","ordinal":"rd"}}},{"id":"6-25-tt0458522","title":"Héctor Lavoe plays to a small audience at the Rubén Rodríguez Coliseum","year":{"id":"1988","path":"/years/1988/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Héctor_Lavoe#Last_years_and_death"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/june/25/","month":{"id":"june","title":"June","path":"/june/"},"day":{"id":"25","ordinal":"th"}}},{"id":"6-26-tt0458522","title":"Héctor Lavoe jumps from the ninth floor of the Condado Regency Hotel","year":{"id":"1988","path":"/years/1988/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Héctor_Lavoe#Last_years_and_death"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/june/26/","month":{"id":"june","title":"June","path":"/june/"},"day":{"id":"26","ordinal":"th"}}}]}},"context":{}}
