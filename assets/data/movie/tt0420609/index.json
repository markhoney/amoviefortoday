There are no suspects. With Harper Lee, he visits the town: he wants to write about their response. First he must get locals to talk, then, after arrests, he must gain access to the prisoners. One talks constantly; the other, Perry Smith, says little. Capote is implacable, wanting the story, believing this book will establish a new form of reportage: he must figure out what Perry wants. Their relationship becomes something more than writer and character: Perry killed in cold blood, the state will execute him in cold blood; does Capote get his story through cold calculation, or is there a price for him to pay?","year":{"id":"2006","path":"/released/2006/"},"score":{"id":"70"},"runtime":110,"awards":"3 wins & 2 nominations.","directors":[{"title":"Douglas McGrath","path":"/directors/douglas_mcgrath/"}],"actors":[{"title":"Sigourney Weaver","path":"/actors/sigourney_weaver/"},{"title":"Toby Jones","path":"/actors/toby_jones/"},{"title":"Gwyneth Paltrow","path":"/actors/gwyneth_paltrow/"},{"title":"Sandra Bullock","path":"/actors/sandra_bullock/"}],"images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"classification":{"title":"R","path":"/classifications/r/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Biography","image":"/img/genres/Biography.png","path":"/genres/biography/"},{"title":"Crime","image":"/img/genres/Crime.png","path":"/genres/crime/"},{"title":"Drama","image":"/img/genres/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}],"events":[{"id":"3-22-tt0420609","title":"Richard Hickock and Perry Smith are tried in court for murder","year":{"id":"1960","path":"/years/1960/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Cold_Blood#Investigation_and_trial"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/march/22/","month":{"id":"march","title":"March","path":"/march/"},"day":{"id":"22","ordinal":"nd"}}},{"id":"4-14-tt0420609","title":"Truman Capote attends the executions of Richard Hickock and Perry Smith","year":{"id":"1965","path":"/years/1965/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hickock#Execution"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/april/14/","month":{"id":"april","title":"April","path":"/april/"},"day":{"id":"14","ordinal":"th"}}},{"id":"11-16-tt0420609","title":"Truman Capote reads an article about the murders of the Herbert Clutter family","year":{"id":"1959","path":"/years/1959/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutter_family_murders"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/november/16/","month":{"id":"november","title":"November","path":"/november/"},"day":{"id":"16","ordinal":"th"}}},{"id":"12-30-tt0420609","title":"Richard Hickock and Perry Smith are arrested","year":{"id":"1959","path":"/years/1959/"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Edward_Smith#The_murders_and_life_on_death_row"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/december/30/","month":{"id":"december","title":"December","path":"/december/"},"day":{"id":"30","ordinal":"th"}}}]}},"context":{}}
