The Kartemquin film features then and now interviews with organizers and participants of the boycott with never-released 16mm footage of the march and student interviews. 63 Boycott and its companion website will provide a modern perspective on the impact and legacy of this forgotten history 50 years later as it reconnects the participants to each other and the event itself.","director":"Gordon Quinn","year":2014,"rating":0,"runtime":"","actors":[],"awards":"","images":null,"rated":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"id":"documentary","name":"Documentary","icon":"/images/genre/white/Documentary.png"}],"countries":[{"id":"usa","name":"USA","icon":"/images/country/map/United States.png"}],"languages":[{"id":"english","name":"English","icon":"/images/language/flag/United Kingdom.png"}]}}]}}]}},"context":{}}
