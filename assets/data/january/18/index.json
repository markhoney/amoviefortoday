A woman called Dahlia is the one overseeing the operation. She was in the Middle East with the other members of the organization, discussing the operation when some Israelis came in; the leader, Major Kobakov had his gun on her but didn't shoot her. Kobakov then informed the US what they found. Though they don't know what their operation is, Kobakov assures them that it will be devastating. So, with FBI man, Corley, they try to find out what it is before it's too late. But they both have different ways of doing things, and since Kobakov is the visitor, he is warned to watch it. Dahlia's \"partner in crime\" is Michael Lander, a Vietnam P.O.W., who is psychologically scarred by that experience, thus making him very susceptible to her machinations.","year":{"id":"1977","path":"/released/1977/"},"score":{"id":"68"},"votes":6231,"runtime":143,"awards":"2 nominations.","images":{"poster":null},"classification":{"title":"R","path":"/classifications/r/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Adventure","image":"/img/genres/Adventure.png","path":"/genres/adventure/"},{"title":"Crime","image":"/img/genres/Crime.png","path":"/genres/crime/"},{"title":"Drama","image":"/img/genres/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"},{"title":"Thriller","image":"/img/genres/Thriller.png","path":"/genres/thriller/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}]}},{"id":"1-18-tt3268458","title":"thousands of websites join an internet blackout","info":{"wikipedia":null},"year":{"id":"2012","path":"/years/2012/"},"dayofyear":{"month":{"title":"January"},"day":{"id":"18","ordinal":"th"}},"refreshments":[],"mention":"","movie":{"id":"tt3268458","path":"/movie/tt3268458/","title":"The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz","plot":"The story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaron Swartz. From Swartz's help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz's groundbreaking work in social justice and political organizing combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties.","year":{"id":"2014","path":"/released/2014/"},"score":{"id":"80"},"votes":15148,"runtime":105,"awards":"4 wins & 3 nominations.","images":{"poster":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/tt3268458.6d0d83a.f18d5ad711946f7e14b38295febf8d84.jpg","size":{"width":200,"height":300},"sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px","srcset":["/assets/static/tt3268458.6d0d83a.f18d5ad711946f7e14b38295febf8d84.jpg 200w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 200 300' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-6762fcf6c1cd94925b68bb11d36cab2f'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-6762fcf6c1cd94925b68bb11d36cab2f)' width='200' height='300' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCABgAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAAYDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAUGAwcI/8QANhAAAgEDAwIFAQUGBwAAAAAAAQIDAAQRBRIhBjETIkFRcWEHFBUjMhYlQoGRoRczUmJywdH/xAAYAQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBP/EAB0RAQEBAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQIhAxIxIlH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AOVzzRGj7UKAKgaPsaFAKjbGR7ih6nPtSc4NKB4ag2dkTZGOM%2btOtNkjhacyEAYAx796Zx5MiKvcjFEpwJSe/amRGzjIB4pJGPY/FTcmmTYTsM/wlcNQutFu4IfEmiKJjsanQgyOM0a4NKkwDj2pcEe4kEEjHpQGNkwMg5U9jRAelAnBOM4o1IyM0weWoXErNzgd6br/AJLEnue1BJtqyL6MKIsvgoM85JNBu5W6N6anjka4sIm3DIUqM/HzXOH2jdP6zHdv95iTSNHMp8GCW7BVQTgMcnIzj49qm4%2btNf8Aw9WF68jcY3c1dekrQ9W6Pem61T7zJdsst1Z3trHLGpTAVkyARj6H1%2btYcfze0W/yNB3vSMCWD3Nlrdleyou9oYtwO3tkZAyKq9xIw/LGBjjiuget/sruLPMtlcGS%2bXMCpI0duiIi52qMgAAc/wB%2ba0vL0xqLNZhVtmkvZVjt0FzHvkLOUBC7s7SynzduM9q1l0%2bN2HcGjp%2bzMuoyyJiSOQEY5V1IwP55ppovTV3qNjHeRC2eGS4W1RTcormVjhV2E55%2bO3NSt7051DDo5sktFmtg8J8WGZJFbxXKodwOMFl2/QjnGaw6TZ69p1tpqwQ2QD3sN9CslxGH3LuCFhuyqHB5OPmnD%2bMlp0jLcRGQRwRxhDIXmuEjUKJPD7sR/HxUY2nWQJBeLI44lH/tW2zv%2brUvrq1uo7e8mgia0nd9RKlPz1faZUlGD4jhcZxzjuDWtJ0ZZpA6FGDEFfY57Uw6B0LRRqHRDX8cLhELBsoQRjv81bvsaDajpmqwSWrR3NkyxCR12l435BI9wV/vU30n1nqkfSF4mtx2340rnwNkAjVt/wCnKDvg%2b1VqPXusodVivtQjVpdgH5MG2MgH1Ud/XmuYt4xd%2bpI7m6smjSUNLGJW8ydgwIbJJ7AHjtXOV1faxZGyh/DbiRtElE0alJgv5c3BZQ%2bz9cqLuC58y1v3q3qGFOmbi8ktiBcQmKWBm2MCcZAOOMEexrnP/EW7sr1xHp1q8YnWRY3ZjiNYRGsROeR5UfPqyA1p4%2by4/aeXfU/UdrqNrqN3AVEUUUxee1Zlljilkjw%2bW8y7pGQn3RexoWd7qGoaDp8ngTPZ2bKqTRiTBVWIJ8PxCD5nUEhe5Az71mTq%2b6l6al0aW3heFoI4kkYkvGVl8RmX/lwCO3lB7in2hdbXOk9Px2VtaRmSBmdJXclcmRJMlMckFBg5/lWsVm9LFoyajp/Vjag2mzNd3UzSSmONh5nm7Ao/o5CFSTnOGAyKpt/LGIdQaaApcNOxUAbQg3HIx6f9VM6D1S0N5%2b6LP7jAkdzlBMzsXnUKzbjjgBVwP9vJJ5qp37O28Od0hbHfvzTLHZmnWHUsdrGlzq2mPMFwsz2KmVM98YbB/pUXrHT148kdzqfUF9eIjBvB3hI%2bOSWVQAfipfTNIt9Ut4tSvbyZ7ggGNhIQB7cA4rW/2pa5qOnfu4XjTzyDbGuMMQfUn4rjm1XPy2zFc%2b1PrGO/Q2lrnERIOOzH3%2bK0Y7FpGY8knNXPWo/u1q/iuJLl/wBRHYfQVS5UKEqfXmujhMTxnWkscHjj6VnDKLUjPmNNsVkbtx9BVmy2lw0G7acZpE0zuQSec5zSPWhMMMB9KDbS0rqjVoLJLa31a5EAG0IsvAH0PcVgu9S2s89xLumb9UsjlmP8yc1rQEjscURJPc5%2baj1R6TU7rGqRyuRE3iH39Kg2YsxLck0mgKqTFDpWcigo5pRX2pggH%2btJkJL5NL7GlrCJT5GG7/SaA//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}},"classification":{"title":"NOT RATED","path":"/classifications/not_rated/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Documentary","image":"/img/genres/Documentary.png","path":"/genres/documentary/"},{"title":"Biography","image":"/img/genres/Biography.png","path":"/genres/biography/"},{"title":"Crime","image":"/img/genres/Crime.png","path":"/genres/crime/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","image":"/img/countries/maps/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","image":"/img/countries/flags/gb.svg","path":"/languages/english/"}]}}]}},"context":{}}
