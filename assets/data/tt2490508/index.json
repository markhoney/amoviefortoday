The Kartemquin film features then and now interviews with organizers and participants of the boycott with never-released 16mm footage of the march and student interviews. 63 Boycott and its companion website will provide a modern perspective on the impact and legacy of this forgotten history 50 years later as it reconnects the participants to each other and the event itself.","directors":["Gordon Quinn"],"actors":[],"year":2014,"rating":0,"runtime":"","awards":"","images":{"poster":null},"rated":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"id":"documentary","name":"Documentary","icon":"/images/genre/white/Documentary.png"}],"countries":[{"id":"usa","name":"USA","map":"/images/country/map/United States of America.png"}],"languages":[{"id":"english","name":"English","country":null}]}},"context":{}}
