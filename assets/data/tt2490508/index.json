The Kartemquin film features then and now interviews with organizers and participants of the boycott with never-released 16mm footage of the march and student interviews. 63 Boycott and its companion website will provide a modern perspective on the impact and legacy of this forgotten history 50 years later as it reconnects the participants to each other and the event itself.","directors":["Gordon Quinn"],"actors":[],"year":2014,"rating":0,"runtime":"","awards":"","images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"rated":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Documentary","icon":"/images/genre/white/Documentary.png","path":"/genres/documentary/"}],"countries":[{"title":"USA","icon":"/images/country/map/United States of America.png","path":"/countries/usa/"}],"languages":[{"title":"English","icon":"/images/country/flag/United Kingdom.png","path":"/languages/english/"}]}},"context":{}}
