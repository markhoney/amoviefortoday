Takako was raised by her uncle and aunt. While in her hometown she stays with her friend, Natsue Morikawa, who has become infertile due to the side effect of the A-bomb. While walking along the destroyed city, she sees a former family friend, Iwakichi, who worked with her father, and is almost blind and has become a beggar. She pays a visit to his shanty in the slums and discovers that his grandson, Taro, is living in an orphanage since Iwakichi's shanty is no place to raise the child. When Morikawa tells her that three former pupils from the kindergarten have survived to the bombing, Takako pays a visit to each one of them and finds how the A-bomb and the radiation have affected their lives. Before returning home, Takako asks Iwakachi to let her bring Taro with her; but their bond is very strong.","directors":["Kaneto Shindô"],"actors":["Nobuko Otowa","Osamu Takizawa","Masao Shimizu","Jûkichi Uno"],"year":1952,"rating":78,"votes":"900","runtime":"97","awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","images":{"poster":{"path":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/tt0044497.5e31822.e692e03403353af1ea47e8beec6bf620.jpg","size":{"width":300,"height":450},"sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px","srcset":["/assets/static/tt0044497.5e31822.e692e03403353af1ea47e8beec6bf620.jpg 300w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 300 450' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-402c80b9146edd2ab4c5c004e7941e00'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-402c80b9146edd2ab4c5c004e7941e00)' width='300' height='450' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bMVYXhBqibqfSn1F0QUzY7ymHVbCgLIAIOOxweR70WubQpKikFQPBxyK2scZG3b36YoBDVcJ1vUUS5Mx3JKhhCUNE7kq5GcdCMH/qjJnd5KN/CsDIoOuMu4I1a2hhJdi/8AIMH09Bwf3n8UYhQ2AjkUERqZLMm3PQ3SAp9BSjnBzjqPkV5NJNm32iJAd3rcQnaXFDlZ6kn2qvtcayttp8Q3G7wh0RWYiWW3QkqSHFHerIHfaRz1GfmivRd1tuqnBdLdK89iKFMBIyn1nBypJ7gY/dAa02axKhWtaxg8igBdYa8i22bc7chp4PQmEuuvKG1AK/tSk9STz06YqS8Jn4kvSbMuDKlyUOqO5cl1S1bwfUPUSQAe1c8%2bJ90kuXqXHeR5Tkt8y3vVkkfY0g/4oSPyo%2b1Wd/pluZctF5til5%2bmfQ8hOeiVpwf/AEk0FlNOsyX3FhSHW1PYSoeoKBHH4rRN1NZ7c4uJMu8KM%2bg4U26%2blKk55GQTnoaiXoNygajEOA8w3CeTva8xO7BSCcHuMnAyOcCgaY3C1DG1A7dtOw3tXwgUfTeaoJURwkpyRlPfrz260FZ%2bLN2N21RLCdpabkuLQsEHzElKQlWRwRhIx8UV%2bAN7jWqHfWZs1iKCtp1HmuBO7hQOMn%2bqBJOnZUWwJuVzZkMrclrYSlScfaAVEj/I4/Bq3PDbQNiZ05AuVzbjyZ0%2bMh0tysKS3nkAJPfGP1QHCdUxllkRbjGkqdUEpSy4lahnuQD0rNMycpUkJdA4Kgeg9hz7mvAxGi6ahuOShYorgJO6LFCCtHXBA5zQFqrxFfbuiPoH0%2bWzhwFxk7MpOUkDOSc8Z/Y4oK613ZnbTqB9qVObkyAAXACApBJIAwPYAfuiDwEuxg6zmM4eUmXFxhpBWcpUMZA7eo80I6i1U/fY5M5hkzCRmQkeogZ4Pxz0rZ4X3B23a9tTrCylSlLaOOchSCMfvFB1tMtbsqcoF1QU2nKVhI6mhOJo1TmsJ82Y1u8xDa8bwcnGOex/FWLt9RVk5PGcmsfKT5hcwrdjGcmgq/Xehg9aPprepxIXvAQv1JSojjHsKwNlMK4wLY%2b8EttxypRWonAAA2pOPbnnHerTU0lXUE/k1GTNOWuY6HZEUqXgJyHFpyB24NBQmop7jbyYEFqS%2by6skvN5JAJAx0PB5I6fPFRUu0263WmcJzz8pQaKUR/PAQnnk5GCcYHft3roJ/Q2nns%2bZbyAeoS%2b4gH%2b8KGfzTP6E01IJ820skEfaCoJ/QOBQcg/wsp5KVxokjYsbkhSckj3HuM96LtAaYWzd4U95h5%2bXGcD6YiVhtS8fZt3D1c9R7DtXSsTR1hiSA%2bxb0pcAKQouLPB%2bCcUnNHWJx8vKg/7hAGQ6scDOBwfk/ugIKFbqpcufcG41xaDjzS4kdPmrQYz6WlFXAGFcKQr4xxRVQ%2brTsGNdFXRyQ6l5Ulx4lWNuXW0tbenThOPnrxQQzhkPrcZYvzBdmsvvxAXFI3IdLa2VDAwAEMvdO2SO9ZynXJMy5SGruyyh0bkNpfWfS40hDYCcDjzELUFJ%2b4nHc1kLDYy7CLlweUuNCRb0pUQPMabDiFBQxyVBawcY6ApxTvWiySbeliTc1vByGmC044lO4MhXQYT924J9XUFAIxzkHaalh4xV3lKJCvpYSFodVvDqB5i8JKcbltpKsc9wfelIdck6fgpRfIfmpjvOvOpdU2lY9SfNB5ICFkcHjt7VuTb7N/Li5/XuGQzJE7cr3SwtnB45G3effI69qj39OacXFSxJuLykx46opJIB2LLmQrCeQS6DjplCDjigJbG2uPLuDMmeiTJWpD%2bzd6kNlASkkdgVJWfapeoO22SKi4s3hiVIdfWz5SlqIw63tSEgjHGCgKGMck%2b9TlAqVKlQLAznAz/AFTYHsOPinpUCwPYfqlgew/VKlQKlSpUH//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}},"rated":{"title":"NOT RATED","path":"/rated/not_rated/"},"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Drama","icon":"/images/genre/white/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"},{"title":"War","icon":"/images/genre/white/War.png","path":"/genres/war/"}],"countries":[{"title":"Japan","icon":"/images/country/map/Japan.png","path":"/countries/japan/"}],"languages":[{"title":"Japanese","icon":"/images/country/flag/Japan.png","path":"/languages/japanese/"}]}}}]}}},"context":{}}
