The Rainbow Warrior, a ship belonging to Greenpeace is docked in the port of Auckland, New Zealand when it sinks after an explosion. The incident claims the life of Fernando Pereira, a Portuguese photographer who is on board at the time of the explosion. Suspicions start to grow that the explosion is not an accident. The Rainbow Warrior was originally set head for the Mururoa Archipelago to protest against French nuclear tests there, and to ensure it won't reach its destination, the French secret service takes the necessary steps in doing so. Two French intelligence agents, Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur, appearing as a swiss married couple are being arrested by New Zealand's authorities under suspicion of placing the bombs on board the Rainbow Warrior. The two become subsequently known as the \"fake Mrs and Mrs Turenge\". The French intelligence service has now an indiscreet matter in their hands, and some want to leak information to their sources in the media.","year":2006,"score":64,"runtime":1,"awards":"","images":{"poster":null,"fanart":null},"rated":null,"studios":[],"genres":[{"title":"Drama","icon":"/images/genre/white/Drama.png","path":"/genres/drama/"},{"title":"History","icon":"/images/genre/white/History.png","path":"/genres/history/"}],"countries":[],"languages":[],"events":[{"id":"7-10-tt0483229","title":"the Rainbow warrior is sunk","year":{"id":"1985"},"month":{"title":"July"},"day":{"id":"10","ordinal":"th"},"info":{"wikipedia":{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior"}},"dayofyear":{"path":"/7/10/","month":{"id":"7","title":"July"},"day":{"id":"10","ordinal":"th"}}}]}},"context":{}}
