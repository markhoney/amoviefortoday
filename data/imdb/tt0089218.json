But when Mikey stumbles upon a treasure map of the famed \"One-Eyed\" Willy's hidden fortune, Mikey, Brandon, and their friends Lawrence \"Chunk\" Cohen, Clark \"Mouth\" Devereaux, Andrea \"Andy\" Carmichael, Stefanie \"Stef\" Steinbrenner, and Richard \"Data\" Wang, calling themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest to find the treasure in hopes of saving their neighborhood. The treasure is in a cavern, but the entrance to the cavern is under the restaurant of evil thief Mama Fratelli and her sons Jake Fratelli, Francis Fratelli, and the severely disfigured Lotney \"Sloth\" Fratelli. Sloth befriends the Goonies and decides to help them.",
